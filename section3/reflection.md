## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

Before reading this article I would say I wasn't the type to seek a challenge. The author talked about taking challenges head on, and it inspired me to do so in the exercises for section 3. I was intimidated by the final you do in the loops-arrays exercise, however I was able to complete it with no problem on the first try once I decided to face the challenge head on.

I would also say that the way the author discussed seeking help as a sign of strength instead of weakness made me look differently at asking for help.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I believe that I demonstrate a Growth Mindset in my ability to face challenges head on, believing that I can improve myself with repeated practice, and by not letting mistakes get me down.

I also believe that to improve my Growth Mindset I must focus on improving my ability to set S.M.A.R.T goals to prevent misinterpretation of due dates as well as general procrastination.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

I frequently use the Reddit app on my phone to browse different subreddits. I suspect that they likely use arrays to list all of the subreddit names as they all begin with 'r/' and that could easily be accomplished in a loop with concatenation.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An Array method is an action that is taken on the array in order to change it in some way. This involves adding or removing items from the array as an example.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

Use of a loop can be seen with longer arrays in which it may be too tedious to manually type out console.log for each item to be printed or responded to based on value.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

You can use a loop as a tool that will perform your desired task to each item in your list, also called an array.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

Are `i--` loops used when you sort videos on YouTube from most views to least views?
