## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

The Pomodoro technique took me out of my comfort zone, but i believe this to be for the better. Generally when I sit down to work, I will work for around three or four hours before I take an hour long break. The only issue with this is that sometimes it can be easy to push the break even longer, to the point of not going back to finish the work.
This technique allowed me to put in short bursts of work while still going about my life's activities, which felt freeing.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

I was surprised at how much I was thinking about when my next break would be as I was worried that I would get too absorbed into my work and forget. I'm sure that this is an issue that is resolved with practice over time.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

Both Objects and Arrays store data. Arrays are accessed via index positions, whereas Objects can be accessed via strings.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class - Array
  * List of states and their capitals - Object
  * List of things to pack for vacation - Array
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow - Array
  * List of student names and their cohort - Object
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake - Object
  * All my favorite restaurants - Array

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
